Questions to be clarified.

1. "...add a 10% service charge on food..." - Does it mean that the Starters and Mains should be charged and Drinks should not?
If Yes, so current implementation is Ok.

2. When exactly we can consider that the order performes before 19-00?
Is it order time or paying time?
This question bear the set of questions for all of test cases.

3. Test #1
Is the order before 19-00 or later?
To cover the test entirely there were two tests created.

4. Test #2
Does it matter that first two people continue with other? 
Looks like they should pay with Drink discounts as they ordered before 19-00.

5. Test #3
It is not clear how the order can be cancelled once it was already sent to endpoint?
